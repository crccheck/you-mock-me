You Mock Me
===========

Learn how to use `unittest.mock` through a series of tests.


Instructions
------------

Go through each exercise in the `exercises` directory. Add code between the
`#####` lines to get the tests to pass.

Run `make test` to run the tests. To run just the test for an exercise, run
`make test/<n>`. So for example, if you're working on excercise_9.py, you would
run `make test/9`.


Python
------

This is designed for Python 3, but should also work for Python 2 if you install
the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
