You Mock Me
===========

Learn how to use `unittest.mock` through a series of tests.


Instructions
------------

1. Go through each exercise in the `exercises` directory.
2. In each exercise, you'll find at least one test case that needs fixing.
3. For each `# BEGIN` and `# END` block, there's one line of code missing that
   will make the test pass.
4. Run `make test` to run the tests. To run just the test for an exercise, run
   `make test/<n>`. So for example, if you're working on excercise_9.py, you
   would run `make test/9`.

If you get stuck, you can see one possible solution in the `solutions/`
directory.


Python
------

This is designed for Python 3, but should also work for Python 2 if you install
the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
